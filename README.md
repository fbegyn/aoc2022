# Advent of code 2022

It's that time of the year again in whcih I realise I know nothing of
programming and people on the internet show me some amazing concepts and ideas
about the programming languages I use.

This year, the languages I pick will be Go. Past few months have gotten me a bit
rusty in this language. It's time to brush up my Go skills again and take a running
start into working on my projects again.
